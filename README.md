# ISC_250

http://cs.oswego.edu/~jmeritt/ISC_250/homepage.html

This is the class webpage created for ISC_250 - Programming through Mobile Application.
All labs and projects for this class will be posted here along with the link for the main homepage for the website.

Note:
There are multiple folders for styles and javascript, this was done intentionally due to each lab consisting of different aspects. If not done as a stylistic choice to keep each lab centered around itself; there would be only one folder for css files and one folder for javascript files.
