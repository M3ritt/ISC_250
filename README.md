# ISC_250

http://cs.oswego.edu/~jmeritt/ISC_250/homepage.html

This is the class webpage created for ISC_250 - Programming through Mobile Application.
This just provides an easy way to find the website that I created. 

All of the website was written in: HTML, Javascript and CSS.

Note:
There are multiple folders for styles and javascript, this was done intentionally due to each lab consisting of different aspects. If not done as a stylistic choice to keep each lab centered around itself; there would be only one folder for css files and one folder for javascript files.
