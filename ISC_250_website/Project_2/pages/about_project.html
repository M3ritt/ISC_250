			<h3>Description of the project</h3>
			<br> <br>
			<a> 
				This website was created by Josh Meritt who is a senior at SUNY Oswego who is majoring in computer science and minoring in information science.
				Being a big fan of Tetris, the goal of this project is to create a replication of the original game of Tetris, but with a few changes for ease of the project. <br><br>
		
			<div id="controls" class="controls">		
				The controls of the game: <br><br>
				<div v-for="(value, name) in object">
					{{ name }}: {{ value }}
				</div>
				<br><br>
			</div> 
			</a>
		</div>
		
		<div id="game_process" class="main">
			Process of how the game runs:  <br><br>
			<!--- 
				I kept this as HTML and not vue like the other lists because having a list within a list with numbers as first list was causing to be difficult with current vue knowledge.
				That being said, changed the id to be seperate from others in case it was desired to change it. 
			
			<div v-for="(value, name, index) in object">
				<div v-if="index == 2">
					{{ index }}: {{ value }} <br>
					
					<div id ="random_spawn" class = "main">
						<li v-for="item in loop_data" :key="item.data">
							{{ item.text }}
						</li>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div v-else>
					{{ index }}: {{ value }}
				</div>
			</div>
			--->
			<ol> 
				<li> A 10 x 20 board is created along with the different types of Tetrominoes (Pieces).</li>
				<li> A random piece is then generated to spawn at the top middle of the board and slowly fall.  </li>
					
				<ul>  
					<li> Each Piece can be moved to the right, left, down or rotated.</li>
					<li> As each piece is moved in any of the previously stated directions, it is undrawn from the previous and then redrawn after the move.  </li>
				</ul>
					
				<li> If the Piece hits a wall or another Piece that has already fallen: That Piece is then locked into place and three scenarios can happen: </li>
					
				<ul>
					<li> The Piece could go past the top row and result in game over. </li>
					<li> The Piece can fill up a row and the row must be cleared and all above rows must be moved downward. In this case, the score must be changed.  </li>
					<li> The Piece can be locked into position without clearing a line. </li>
				</ul>
					
				<li> Step 3 is repeated until game over. </li>
			</ol>
			For a more in concrete explanation, there are comments on the JavaScript code explanining how the code works. 
			</a>

		<div id="improvements" class="main">

			<h3> What could be improved</h3> 
			<br> <br>
			<a> 
				While the game currently runs fine, some improvements could be made to increase the quality of the game such as: <br><br>
			
				<li v-for="item in loop_data" :key="item.text">
					{{item.text}}
				</li>
			<br>
				Since I created a working application and was running low on time, I thought to keep what I have and make updates later if desired. <br>
				The code for this project can be found on <a href = "https://github.com/M3ritt/ISC_250/tree/master/ISC_250_website/Project_1" target="_blank"> GitHub</a>.
