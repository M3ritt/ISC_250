			<h3>Description of the project</h3>
			<br> <br>
			<a> 
				This website was created by Josh Meritt who is a senior at SUNY Oswego who is majoring in computer science and minoring in information science.  <br>
				Being a big fan of Tetris, the goal of this project is to create a replication of the original game of Tetris, 
				but with color and adding a limit to how many keys can be pressed for each Tetromino. <br><br>
				
				
				The controls of the game: 
				<center> 
						<a>'A' - left</a><br>
						<a> 'D' - right</a><br>
						<a> 'W' - hard drop</a><br>
						<a> 'Enter' - rotate</a><br>	
				</center> <br><br>
				
				Process of how the game runs:  <br><br>
				<ol> 
					<li> A 10 x 20 board is created along with the different types of Tetrominoes (Pieces).</li>
					<li> A random piece is then generated to spawn at the top middle of the board and slowly fall.  </li>
					
					<ul>  
						<li> Each Piece can be moved to the right, left, down or rotated.</li>
						<li> As each piece is moved in any of the previously stated directions, it is undrawn from the previous and then redrawn after the move.  </li>
					</ul>
					
					<li> If the Piece hits a wall or another Piece that has already fallen: That Piece is then locked into place and three scenarios can happen: </li>
					
					<ul>
						<li> The Piece could go past the top row and result in game over. </li>
						<li> The Piece can fill up a row and the row must be cleared and all above rows must be moved downward. In this case, the score must be changed.  </li>
						<li> The Piece can be locked into position without clearing a line. </li>
					</ul>
					
					<li> Step 3 is repeated until game over. </li>
				</ol>
				For a more in concrete explanation, there are comments on the JavaScript code explanining how the code works.
