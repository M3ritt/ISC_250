				Task 2 for this assignment states to not change the html so I did not want to add the stylesheet on .html file or already had a specific style. <br>
				That also means that the link opens a new tab instead of go directly to the page. <br><br>
			</a>
			
			<h3> Note: </h3>
			<a>
				I don't know if this was intentional or not, but for task 3 I noticed that changing the numbers for the sides of the die do not matter to ones that were already created. 
				It only affects the die created after it was changed. <br><br>
				
				Also, for my task 1; instead of having a user stop at the first and last positions in the array, I just have it loop around for ease of use. 
			
			<br>
				The list of Tasks: 
				<ul>
					<li> <a href="./task_1/task_1.html">Task 1</a> : Using JavaScript to update a table and display correct data based on going to next or previous element in an array. </li>
					<li> <a href="./task_2/task_2.html" target = "_blank">Task 2</a> : Fix JavaScript of a given page to work correctly. </li>
					<li> <a href="./task_3/task_3.html">Task 3</a> : Fix JavaScript of a given page to work correctly. </li>
				</ul>
